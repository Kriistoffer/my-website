## MY-WEBSITE

This repository contains all the code for my own personal website.

# Techniques, frameworks, packages, services, and whatnot used in this project:

- Next.js (with server actions)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Prettier
- ESLint
- Framer-motion
- React-icons
- React-email
- Resend
- React-hot-toast
- React-intersection-observer
- React-vertical-timeline-component
- Clsx

While there probably are things that could be optimised better, and certain packages replaced with own custom-made components, I've made the decision to use a couple of popular packages recommended by others just to get a hang of them.

Over time, some of them might end up being replaced by components created by myself, or other third party packages. This is used as a learning experience, which is why this project will include a lot of everything.
